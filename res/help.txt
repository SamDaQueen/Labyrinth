<ul>
<li><strong>Otyugh</strong>: There are multiple Otyugh spread throughout the dungeon.
 If you encounter an Otyugh, it will devour you and the game will end!
  Luckily, you will have arrows to try and kill the monster.<br>
If you hit the monster once, it will be injured and if you encounter them, you might have a chance of escaping.
 The Otyugh can be killed by shooting it twice.
 <br>They are filthy creatures, and you will be able to smell them from neighboring cells.<br>
 A faint stench: a monster two cells away from you. A strong stench: either
  an Otyugh is in the next cell or there are more than one Otyugh near you.</li>
<li><strong>Shadow</strong>: The Shadow monster will roam around the dungeon looking for you.
 If it finds you, you will enter combat mode, and you might be able to kill the monster,

 if finds you, it will steal all of your treasure. And you may encounter him again and again. Beware!</li>
<li><strong>Pits</strong>: Certain caves have a giant pit which you will fall into if you enter the cave.
 You will survive, but while trying to climb out, you will lose all of your treasures and arrows.
